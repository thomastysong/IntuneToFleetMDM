SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Migrate Windows devices from Intune MDM to Fleet Windows MDM using supported Windows MDM APIs.

DESCRIPTION
    IntuneToFleetMDM uses mdmregistration.dll APIs:
      - UnregisterDeviceWithManagement(0) to remove the current MDM enrollment (e.g., Intune)
      - RegisterDeviceWithManagement(..., https://<fleet-host>/api/mdm/microsoft/discovery, <token>) to enroll into Fleet

    Enrollment is verified using OS state (Enrollments + OMADM registry), not only return codes.

COMMANDS
    Get-ITFMDMEnrollmentState
    Test-ITFMDMMigrationPrereqs
    Invoke-ITFMDMMigration
    Get-ITFMDMLogs

EXAMPLES
    # Check prereqs for a target Fleet instance
    Test-ITFMDMMigrationPrereqs -FleetHost '<fleet-host>'

    # Full migration
    Invoke-ITFMDMMigration -FleetHost '<fleet-host>'

    # Enroll-only retry (skip unenroll)
    Invoke-ITFMDMMigration -FleetHost '<fleet-host>' -SkipUnenroll

NOTES
    - Must run elevated (SYSTEM/Admin).
    - Some environments behave better in MTA; Invoke-ITFMDMMigration can relaunch in MTA when needed.
